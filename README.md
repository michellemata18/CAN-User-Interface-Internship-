# CAN-User-Interface-Internship-
This repository includes the C-programming needed to read CAN frames through a UIR. This project was done using LabWindows/CVI.

This repository only includes a C file because other #include files are property of Continental AG.

This project was a portion of my internship while at Continental AG. The goal was to design and make a functional UI that was compatible
with CAN interfaces USB-8473 and USB-8505. The UI needed to read CAN frames from a NOx sensor which was produced in-house. It also
needed to be compatible with older and newer NOx sensor models.
